# Exploring SAINT-base model
This work is on predicting protein secondary structure. Here we tried to improve the model SAINT-base architecture. 
SAINT paper can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/17/4599/5841663). Their [code](https://github.com/SAINTProtein/SAINT) is available as open source.

# Input Features
* Physio-chemical properties
* PSSM profile
* HMM profile

### Physio-chemical propteties
It contains 7 properties of each of the type of amino-acid. Data can be found in [SAINT source code](https://github.com/SAINTProtein/SAINT/blob/master/SAINT/aa_phy7)
For more details on this Paper link:

### PSSM profile
PSSM profile are be generated using [PSI-BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download) on [UniProt90](https://www.uniprot.org/downloads). Note that, to use uniprot90.fasta in PSI-BLAST, it need to be converted to BLAST data format using [mkblastdb](https://ncbi.github.io/magicblast/cook/blastdb.html) command.

### HMM profile
HMM profile are be generated using [HHblits](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite) on [uniprot20_2013_03](http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~compbiol/data/hhsuite/databases/hhsuite_dbs/old-releases/) database. Using 10 threads, it takes usually 3-4 mins for longer sequences.

# Dataset
We used the same training dataset used by SAINT, which was generated by [SPOT-1D](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535134/). The dataset is available from the SPOT-1D [server](https://servers.sparks-lab.org/downloads/SPOT-1D-dataset.tar.gz). It also contains TEST2016 and TEST2018 extracted features.

# Our Code
/model directory contatins our training code of multi-headed attentions and other tweaks.
